# Evan's 6502 SBC Kernel
Here is the source for the kernel for my 6502 based single-board computer. The computer is built with parts I had lying around and a PCB I designed and had manufactured by [JLC](https://jlcpcb.com/)(They have some great deals on small board runs).
I will probably post some videos on youtube once I get it working and doing useful things, so I will link to those here then.

## Schematics
I also have the schematics. I will open source those soon, but they're not great anyways (I'm a software guy, not a hardware guy)
